# docs.snawf.my.id

This site serves as a personal documentation archive for infrastructure, system configuration, and operational decisions I have made over time. It exists primarily as a long-term reference rather than a tutorial, with the assumption that the reader is either myself in the future or someone already familiar with the underlying technologies.

A significant portion of this documentation focuses on my homelab environment, which is built around Proxmox as the primary virtualization platform. This includes notes on initial host setup, virtual machine and container layout, networking decisions, DNS configuration, reverse proxying, and general service hardening. The emphasis is on practical implementation details and trade-offs rather than theoretical explanations.

In addition to the homelab, this documentation also covers aspects of my daily Windows environment. These notes typically relate to PowerShell customization, development and administrative tooling, and hardware- or driver-specific issues encountered on workstation or server-class systems. The goal here is to capture solutions to problems that are easy to forget but time-consuming to rediscover.

Finally, the documentation includes references to workloads and services running in Oracle Cloud. This covers lightweight production or semi-production setups, connectivity between cloud and on-prem environments, and configuration choices made to balance cost, reliability, and simplicity. These sections are intended to document what was deployed, how it was configured, and why certain decisions were made at the time.

Overall, this site functions as a written record of systems I operate and maintain, optimized for recall and continuity rather than presentation.
