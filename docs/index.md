# Welcome to my Docs

This is where I keep track of my setups, configurations, and the random technical hurdles I’ve managed to clear. I built this site mostly as a second brain for myself—if I don't write it down, I'll definitely forget how I fixed it.

### What’s in here?

* **Homelab (Proxmox):** This is where I document my home server experiments. It covers everything from the initial node setup to repository tweaks and getting services running smoothly.
* **Windows:** These are the specific configurations and fixes I encounter at my desk. It’s mostly PowerShell customizations, environment tweaks, and resolving those annoying little issues that pop up in a professional Windows environment.
* **DevOps Tools:** A collection of notes on the tools I use daily, like VS Code and various CLI utilities, to keep my workflow from falling apart.

Feel free to poke around. Hopefully, some of the notes here save you the same headaches they saved me.
