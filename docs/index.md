# docs.snawf.my.id

This site is my personal documentation space. I use it to keep track of system setups, configuration decisions, and infrastructure work I’ve done over time. It’s not meant to be a tutorial or a polished guide — it’s primarily a long-term reference for myself, written with the assumption that future-me already understands the basics but needs the details.

Most of the content here comes from things I actively run, maintain, or have broken and fixed more than once. The focus is on *what* I set up, *how* it’s configured, and *why* certain decisions were made at the time.

## Homelab

A large part of this documentation revolves around my homelab environment, built primarily on Proxmox. These notes cover initial host setup, virtual machines and containers, networking and DNS decisions, reverse proxies, tunneling, and general service hardening. The emphasis is on real-world configuration and trade-offs rather than theory.

## Windows

This section documents my daily Windows environment. Most of it is practical, experience-driven stuff: PowerShell customization, tooling setup, quality-of-life tweaks, and fixes for hardware or driver issues that are annoying to troubleshoot more than once. If I had to dig for a solution, it probably ended up here.

## Oracle Cloud

I also keep notes on workloads running in Oracle Cloud. These are usually lightweight deployments tied back to on-prem systems or used for specific purposes. The focus here is on basic architecture, connectivity, and configuration choices aimed at keeping things simple, reliable, and cost-effective.

Overall, this site acts as a written record of systems I operate and maintain — optimized for recall and continuity, not presentation.
